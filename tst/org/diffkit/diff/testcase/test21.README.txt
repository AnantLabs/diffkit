Description
----------
Test of diffKind property in MagicPlan. Plan limits diffs to ROW_DIFF diffs only. 
If BOTH kinds of diffs were reported, there would be 4 COLUMN_DIFFs, in addition
to the 2 ROW_DIFFs. But the diffKind property filters those out.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are File tables
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- MagicPlan figures everything out
- only report ROW diffs


Expectations
-----------
- no column diffs in expected, even though column diffs exist between sources
- two row diffs
